| Feature / Behavior    | **Raw Pointer**                                                                                 | **`unique_ptr`**                                                                   | **`shared_ptr`**                                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ownership**         | No ownership — it just stores an address. You must manually `delete`.                           | Owns a resource **exclusively** — only one `unique_ptr` can point to it at a time. | Owns a resource **shared** between multiple `shared_ptr`s.           |
| **Copying**           | Can be copied freely (both point to same resource — risk of double deletion).                   | **Copy disabled** — cannot be copied.                                              | **Copy allowed** — increases reference count.                        |
| **Moving**            | Just copy address — no ownership transfer rules.                                                | Move allowed — transfers ownership.                                                | Move allowed — transfers one shared owner.                           |
| **Automatic Cleanup** | ❌ No — must call `delete` manually.                                                            | ✅ Yes — deletes resource when `unique_ptr` goes out of scope.                     | ✅ Yes — deletes resource when last `shared_ptr` owner is destroyed. |
| **Memory Safety**     | ❌ High risk (dangling pointers, leaks).                                                        | ✅ Safe from leaks if used correctly.                                              | ✅ Safe from leaks if used correctly, but more overhead.             |
| **Overhead**          | None.                                                                                           | Very low.                                                                          | Higher (needs control block for ref count).                          |
| **When to Use**       | Rarely, only in low-level APIs or performance-critical spots where manual control is necessary. | When you want sole ownership of a resource.                                        | When resource ownership must be shared.                              |
