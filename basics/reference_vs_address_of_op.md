The `&` symbol in C and C++ is **context-dependent** — it **can mean either "address-of" or "reference"**, but **not both at the same time**. Here's a breakdown:

---

### 1. **Address-of Operator (`&`)**

When used in an **expression**, `&` means “**address of**” a variable.

```cpp
int x = 5;
int* ptr = &x;  // &x gives the address of x
```

Here, `&x` gets the **memory address** of `x`.

---

### 2. **Reference Declaration (`&`)**

When used in a **declaration**, `&` defines a **reference variable**.

```cpp
int x = 10;
int& ref = x;   // ref is a reference to x
```

Here, `int& ref` declares `ref` as a reference to `x`, not a pointer.

---

### So, is `&` **both**?

-   **Yes**: The symbol `&` is _used_ in both concepts.
-   **No**: In any **given context**, it is **either** an address-of operator (expression) **or** a reference declarator (declaration), **not both at once**.

| Context     | Meaning        | Example         |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Expression  | Address-of     | `ptr = &x;`     |
| Declaration | Reference type | `int& ref = x;` |
